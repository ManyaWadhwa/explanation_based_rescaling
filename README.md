# Explanation Based Rescaling
This repository hosts the dataset for explanation based rescaling 

The two datasets used in the experiments are:
1. Inquisitive 
2. Inquisitive-extended 

For articles, please contact the author. The annotations are uploaded to this repository. 
The annotations and articles (once received from the author) can be combined using ``combine_annotations_articles.py`` to a dataframe, where each row is an annotation from the user. The articles and annotations can also be combined into a json using the `article_num` key.  

Please contact manya.wadhwa@utexas.edu for any questions.
